- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lmar-O
- 👀 I just started programming and also just realized I literally don't know anything
- 🌱 I already took 2 intro Java classes and realized I didn't learn a thing so I'm starting CS50 and wanting to die
- 💞️ I’m looking to figure out what I'm gonna do with my life
- 📫 Is there like a way you can DM on here?
